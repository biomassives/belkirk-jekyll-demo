## Project driver

Water improvement projects are fueled by a 'creative tension' which represents the difference between how things are now, and how they could be if a good design and implementation are delivered.

## Design

The portable EEG montoring device (PEMD) is a combination platform of a head-mounted recording system and a portable terminal to be installed on any device running the Android operating system.

The EEG is monitored and recorded using a series of electrodes built into the head-mounted system. The recordings are processed by a microprocessor from analog to digital format, and then sent to the portable terminal via bluetooth.
