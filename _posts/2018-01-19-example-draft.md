## Project Status.

Connection is at the core of this work.  Long term relationships between project partners, Peacewater researchers, volunteers, meeting expert testimony providers, meeting organizers, bloggers and writers, musicians and creatives, contractors, maintenance people.  

This system had been designed to help people develop more meaningful long term connections.  Please let us know if you see anything that could help us improve.
